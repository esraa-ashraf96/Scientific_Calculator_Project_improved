Scientific Calculator Program Documentation

# Introduction:

This is a scientific calculator program implemented in Python using the tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). 

It provides various mathematical functions and operations for scientific calculations.

# Features:

 Basic arithmetic operations:  Addition(+), Subtraction(-), Multiplication(*), Division(÷)

 Trigonometric functions:  Sine, Cosine, Tangent

 Hyperbolic functions:  Sinh, Cosh, Tanh

 Exponential and Logarithmic functions: Exponentiation(e), Natural Logarithm(ln), Logarithm base 2(Log2),Logarithm base 10(Log10), Exponintial Number (e)

 Other mathematical functions: Square Root(v), Cube Root(3v), Factorial(!), Absolute(|x|), Percentage(%)

 Matrix operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, scalar multiplication, inverse, transpose

 Function Solver: linear(aX+b=0),linear system(a1X+b1Y+c1=0,a2X+b2Y+c2=0),quadratic equation(aX^2+bX+c=0),Cubic equation(aX^3+bX^2+cX+d=0)

 Constants: Pi (p), 2*Pi (2p)


# Usage:

± Run the .exe file  OR

± Run the program by executing the Python script.

± The GUI window will appear, displaying the calculator interface.

± Use the buttons to input numbers and perform operations.

± Press the "Clear" (C) button to delete the last character from the input field.

± Press the "Clear Entry" (CE) button to clear the entire input field.

± Press the "=" button to calculate the result.

± The calculator supports the use of parentheses ( ) for complex expressions.

± Functions like degrees to radians conversion (deg), radians to degrees conversion (rad), and others can be accessed through the corresponding buttons.

# Implementation Details:

The click(val) function:

Handles button clicks and performs the corresponding operations.

Mathematical operations are performed using the math module in Python.

Error handling is implemented to handle division by zero and other potential errors.

The GUI is created using tkinter and consists of an entry field and various buttons for different functions and operations.

# Requirements:

Python 3.x

tkinter library (included in standard Python installation).

math library (included in standard Python installation).
